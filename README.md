# Project-Euler

This repository contains my solutions to the popular website [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) which contains lots of computational problems meant to be solved using computer programs.
I mainly use Python to implement my solutions but some of them might be more intuitive to do using simple pen and paper.

### Problems I have worked on:

| Number | Title | Status |
| :------: | :-----: | :------: |
| 1 | [Multiples of 3 or 5](./Python/1.py) | ✅ |
| 2 | [Even Fibonacci Numbers](./Python/2.py) | ✅ |
| 3 | [Largest Prime Factor](./Python/3.py) | ✅ |
| 4 | [Largest Palindrome Product](./Python/4.py) | ✅ |
| 5 | [Smallest Multiple](./Python/5.py) | ✅ |
| 6 | [Sum Square Difference](./Python/6.py) | ✅ |
| 7 | 10001st Prime | ✅ |
| 8 | Largest Product in Series | ✅ |
| 9 | Special Pythagorean Triplet | ✅ |
| 10 | Summation of Primes | ✅ |
| 11 | Largest Product in a Grid | ✅ |
| 12 | Highly Divisible Triangular Number | ✅ |
| 13 | Large Sum | ✅ |
| 14 | Longest Collatz Sequence | ✅ |
